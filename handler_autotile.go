//
// Sway tiles manually — the split direction is whatever you last set with
// `split h`/`split v` — so without help, opening windows one after another
// keeps slicing the same axis and leaves you with ever-narrower columns. This
// handler picks the direction from the shape of the focused container instead:
// wider than tall means the next window goes beside it, taller than wide means
// it goes below. That much is the behaviour of nwg-piotr/autotiling.
//
// On top of that it knows when not to split at all: past a certain point a
// column is too narrow for anything to be usable in it, and what you really
// want is a tabbed container holding both windows at full size. See
// placeNewWindow.
